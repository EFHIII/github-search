# GitHub Search

## Run

in `src/Secrets.re` change `<Token>` to your [GitHub API token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

```sh
npm install
npm run server
# in a new tab
npm start
```

Open a new web page to `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Bundle for Production

We've included a convenience `UNUSED_webpack.config.js`, in case you want to ship your project to production. You can rename and/or remove that in favor of other bundlers, e.g. Rollup.

We've also provided a barebone `indexProduction.html`, to serve your bundle.

```sh
npm install webpack webpack-cli
# rename file
mv UNUSED_webpack.config.js webpack.config.js
# call webpack to bundle for production
./node_modules/.bin/webpack
open indexProduction.html
```

## Handle Routing Yourself

To serve the files, this template uses a minimal dependency called `moduleserve`. A URL such as `localhost:8000/scores/john` resolves to the file `scores/john.html`. If you'd like to override this and handle URL resolution yourself, change the `server` command in `package.json` from `moduleserve ./ --port 8000` to `moduleserve ./ --port 8000 --spa` (for "single page application"). This will make `moduleserve` serve the default `index.html` for any URL. Since `index.html` loads `Index.bs.js`, you can grab hold of the URL in the corresponding `Index.re` and do whatever you want.

By the way, ReasonReact comes with a small [router](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/router) you might be interested in.
